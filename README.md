## REDUX AND REACT
the fundamental implement redux in React application

## WHAT I LEARNED
Use Redux in React App
1. How the store works, that for globalized state
2. action, to declare what the action would be call
3. Reducer, describe how the logic will be operated
4. Dispatch, whta the action will be used.
5. Arange reducers in seperate file
6. Use combineReducers to combine all the reducers that we make in index file. We do not have to declare index.js when we import, due to the javascript will always read the index file.
7. Use the action in seperate file
8. Arrange index.js , import all reducers, create store and use Redux DevTools. 
9. Use Provider tag to access all the store globalized.
